Hello World

Today, we start what we should have started years ago. Hannah and I have been married 7 years this January and a family blog is long overdue.

Max is now 2.5 years old and Ruby is our latest bundle of joy. She's 4 months.

Oct 23-26 our family spent some time together in Park City Utah with some friends from college and we took this family photo overlooking the beautiful valley.
